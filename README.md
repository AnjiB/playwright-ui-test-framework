### The framework and tests to automate Horizon UI consists of several layers.

* **Test Layer**: Contains tests
* **Component Layer**: Contains all the end user functional behavior methods per component.
* **Component Object Layer**: Contains locators per component.
* **Actions Layer**: Contains UI Actions, Page related functionalities
* **Utils Layer**: Contains Utils like Logger. Configs, Date etc
* **Core Layer**:  Core layer contains of Playwright and Allure & other libraries

### Generic flow of a test: 
* A test mainly interacts with PageUtils & Components.
* Components consist of all business / functional methods.
* Components internally get locators from Component Object classes and interact with UIActions & other Utils to perform actions on each individual html elements like button, checkbox, etc.,
* Playwright test runner helps us with testing by providing APIs to run the tests sequentially or in parallel or to run Repeated tests and parameterized tests.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The tests follow a modular and maintainable structure:

## How to run Tests:
### From VSCode
* Import the test project into any IDE like Visual Studio to run the tests on IDE. Note: IDE must have plugin "Playwright Test". Please follow the instructions for VS Code here: https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode
### Running tests from Terminal
* Run all the tests : ```npx playwright test```
* Run the tests only against chrome: ```npm run test:chrome```
* We can also run the test using tags. Ex: ```npm run test:chrome ‚Äî ‚Äì grep @accessibility```
* Run the tests only against projects configured in playwright configuration: ```npx playwright test ‚Äìproject=firefox```

**Note:** Read more instructions here https://playwright.dev/docs/running-tests to know how to run the tests.

We also have support to pass playwright base url from environment variable as below.

```PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL=https://horizon-ui.com/horizon-ui-chakra/admin/default#/admin/default npm run test:chrome -- --grep=@search```
